# CIS472_Machine_Learning
Machine learning is about building predictive or descriptive models automatically from data. There are two central challenges in machine learning. The first is generalizing from data to future situations. A model that performs very well on past data may nonetheless perform very poorly on unseen examples, a phenomenon known as "overfitting". The second challenge is building models efficiently, especially in cases where the dataset is very large and the patterns are complex. We will cover standard methodologies, models, and algorithms for machine learning. Specific topics include decision trees, instance-based learning, linear classifiers, probabilistic classifiers, support vector machines, deep learning, model ensembles, and learning theory.
